A Crate is a compilation unit in Rust

mod declarations will be merged in to the main rs compilations

this will happen before running the compiler

modules do not get compiled only crates (the file I have asked to be compiled)

crate can be compiled into binary or library

default is binary but can be overriden with --crate-type
